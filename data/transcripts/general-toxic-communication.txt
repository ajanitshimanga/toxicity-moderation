Person 1: You're so bad at this game. I can’t believe I have to play with trash like you.
Person 2: Hey, let’s just focus on the game. We can still win if we work together.
Person 2: Everyone has off games sometimes. No need to make it personal.
Person 1: Off games? You’re always terrible! Get off the game if you don’t know how to play.
Person 2: I understand you're frustrated, but blaming others won’t help. Let’s regroup and try a different strategy.
Person 1: Wow, you really think you’re some kind of team leader? You’re just pathetic.
Person 2: I’m just trying to make the best of the situation. It’s more fun when we all get along.
Person 1: Fun? This isn’t fun because of people like you ruining it for everyone.
Person 2: Sorry you feel that way. Let’s just finish the match and maybe things will turn around.
Person 1: Ugh, whatever. You’re hopeless.
Person 2: I get that you're upset. Let’s finish strong, and we can move on from this game.
