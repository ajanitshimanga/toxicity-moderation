FireWielder: Look at you, missing every skill shot. What’s the point of even trying?
NightHawk: I’m working on my aim. Let’s try to coordinate and make the most of our opportunities.

FireWielder: Coordination? You couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn.
NightHawk: We can still win if we work together and stay focused.
FireWielder: Maybe, but it’s hard to be optimistic with you on the team.
NightHawk: I understand. I’ll keep improving, and we’ll keep pushing to win.
