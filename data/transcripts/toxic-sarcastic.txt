DragonSlayer99: Wow, nice job dying again. Are you trying to give them the win or just practice your respawn timer?
ShadowNinjaX: I’m really trying here. Let’s just focus on the game and see if we can come back.
DragonSlayer99: Oh, sure. Just keep feeding them and we’ll see how that works out.
ShadowNinjaX: I’m adjusting my strategy. Let’s regroup and take it step by step.
DragonSlayer99: Regroup? With your skills, we’re better off surrendering.
ShadowNinjaX: I believe we can still turn this around if we work together.
DragonSlayer99: Whatever you say. Just don’t expect me to carry you.

ShadowNinjaX: I’m not asking for that. Let’s try to stay focused and play smart.
