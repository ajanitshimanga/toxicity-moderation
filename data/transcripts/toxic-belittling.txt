EpicGamerPro: Why do you even play this game if you’re so bad? You’re making us lose every time.
NoobMaster5000: I’m having a rough game, but I’m working on it. We need to focus on our team play.

EpicGamerPro: Sure, you’re just a beginner, aren’t you? Quit wasting everyone’s time.
NoobMaster5000: We all started somewhere. Let’s try to support each other and improve as a team.
EpicGamerPro: Support each other? More like you need to get carried.
NoobMaster5000: I’m here to contribute. Let’s keep a positive mindset and see what we can do.
