RagingStorm42: Oh, great. You’re feeding again. It’s almost like you’re trying to lose.

SilentBlade: I’m not trying to lose. I’m working on my gameplay and improving.
RagingStorm42: Right, because losing all the time is definitely a great way to improve.
SilentBlade: We’re all here to win, and I’m doing my best to contribute.
RagingStorm42: Well, your best isn’t good enough, apparently.

SilentBlade: I appreciate the feedback. Let’s focus on our strategy and keep pushing forward.
