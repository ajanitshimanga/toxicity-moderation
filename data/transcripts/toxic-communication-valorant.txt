Person 1: Bro, how are you still Bronze? You’re the worst Reyna I’ve ever seen!
Person 2: Sorry about that, I’m having a rough game. I’ll try to do better next round.
Person 1: Rough game? You’re dragging the whole team down. You should’ve uninstalled ages ago.
Person 2: I get it, losing is frustrating, but let’s focus on the next round. We can still turn this around.
Person 1: Turn it around? Not with you on the team. Seriously, just stop playing ranked.
Person 2: I’m trying to improve, just like everyone else. Let’s communicate and set up a better defense.
Person 1: Communicate? You can’t even aim! You’ve died first every round. Useless.
Person 2: Yeah, my aim’s off today. I’ll play more passively and watch flanks. Let’s stick together.
Person 1: Stick together? Nah, I don’t wanna be anywhere near you. You’re dead weight!
Person 2: Splitting up won’t help either of us win. Let’s just focus on playing smart and giving callouts.
Person 1: Your callouts are trash too. You’ve got no game sense.
Person 2: I’ll work on being more clear with them. Let’s keep the team vibe positive so we can at least have a shot.
