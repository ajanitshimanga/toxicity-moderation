ElitePlayer: Your performance is so pathetic, I can’t even take this game seriously.
CasualGamer: I’m trying my best. Let’s keep a positive attitude and focus on the game.

ElitePlayer: Positive attitude? You’re a joke. This game is doomed with you here.
CasualGamer: I’m here to contribute. Let’s see if we can turn this around with good teamwork.

ElitePlayer: Don’t bother, you’re clearly out of your league.
CasualGamer: I believe we can still win if we work together. I’m committed to improving.
