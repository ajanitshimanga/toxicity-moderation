ProGamerX: Wow, you must be the worst player I’ve ever seen. How did you even get into this game?
TeamPlayer: I’m working on improving. Let’s focus on the game and see what we can achieve together.

ProGamerX: Improve? You’re just making the game worse for everyone.
TeamPlayer: I’m trying my best. If you have specific suggestions, I’m open to them.

ProGamerX: You wouldn’t understand, but whatever. Just try not to ruin the game further.
TeamPlayer: I’ll do my best. Let’s keep our communication positive and work as a team.
